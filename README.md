# Uirlis

    Program written in Python 2.7.1 for plotting equations and modifying their
    parameters on the fly, as well as their plotting options and styles. 
    The equations can be defined by the user by means of small text files with
    metaprogramming and python language methods. Examples are provided in the 
    folder whose name is stored in uirlis.cfg config file.
    
    Programa para graficar ecuaciones y modficar sus parámetros inmediatamente,
    así como también sus representaciones gráficas.
    Las ecuaciones pueden ser definidas mediante el usuario a través de pequeños 
    archivos de texto con metaprogramación y métodos en lenguaje python. Los 
    ejemplos provistos están en la carpeta cuyo nombre está guardado en el archivo
    de configuración uirlis.cfg.

    Huge thanks to the late Felipe Evans, Msc. Eng. for long hours chatting and teaching
    me about programming among many other interesting topics, we all miss you a lot.


    IMPORTANT NOTICE:
    This program was written during the second half of 2015 and january 2016 using
    the matplotlib and gtk frameworks running under Python 2.7.1. No updates or 
    upgrades have been done since then because the author changed his work direction
    from Fatigue to Computational Mechanics and such, so this was discontinued due 
    to lack of time and need. Since then, both Python and the mentioned frameworks 
    changed versions many times, so this is not expected to run out of the box.
    Moreover, this tool (Uirlis) was intended to be just a tool and a way to learn
    more Python language.
    Should anyone have the time and will to upgrade this, they're welcome to do so,
    and the author will be deeply grateful for he does not have the spare time 
    required for the task.
